## Animated Grid Background

<PSpacing2>

During the internship, I had an idea I wanted to realize just for the fun of it - this is that idea. It's an animated grid background that reacts on mousemove. The idea is that when you move your mouse over to the background instead of the divisions with content, the background would move, making the website just a little more interactive and fun.

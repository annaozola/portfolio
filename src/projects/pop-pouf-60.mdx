## Summary

<Grid2>

This project was created to practice product visualization. I recreated [POP Pouf 60 made by Oot Oot studios](https://oot-oot.com/product/pouf-pop-60-2/?v=a7bdee32cb21).

This is another paragraph. Lorem ipsum something something. I need to type something here but I don't know what ahaha.

need it for this project.

## Summary

<Grid2>

This project was created to practice product visualization. I recreated [POP Pouf 60 made by Oot Oot studios](https://oot-oot.com/product/pouf-pop-60-2/?v=a7bdee32cb21).

The project was entirely created using the open source software Blender. Materials were created proceduraly using Blender's node based shader editor. Images were rendered using Cycles.
